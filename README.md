Interpretable prediction of Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) based on FasterRisk algorithm. Other models (unregularized and regularized logistic regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest) are developed for comparison. The 10-fold rolling cross-validation (CV) is used for model evaluation.
